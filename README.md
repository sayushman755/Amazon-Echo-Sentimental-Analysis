# Amazon Echo Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to Amazon Echo using various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on their text content. This ReadMe provides an overview of the project, instructions on usage, dependencies, dataset information, and more.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following main components:

1. **Data Collection:** 
   - Tweets mentioning "Amazon Echo" were collected using the Twitter API.
   - The collected tweets were stored in a CSV file (`data/tweets.csv`).

2. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Text cleaning: Removal of special characters, URLs, and stopwords.
   - Tokenization: Splitting text into tokens or words.
   - Feature extraction: TF-IDF transformation to convert text data into numerical features.

3. **Modeling:** 
   - Implemented several machine learning models:
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
     - LSTM (using TensorFlow/Keras)
   - Trained these models to classify tweets into sentiment categories (negative, neutral, positive).

4. **Evaluation:** 
   - Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Cross-validation techniques were applied to assess model robustness.

5. **Deployment:** 
   - The best-performing model was selected and deployed to predict sentiments of new tweets mentioning "Amazon Echo".
   - Adjustments to the model and preprocessing steps were made based on evaluation results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected via the Twitter API. Each tweet is labeled with sentiment:
- **-1:** Negative sentiment
- **0:** Neutral sentiment
- **1:** Positive sentiment
